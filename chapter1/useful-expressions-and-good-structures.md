The key insights driving the algorithm are that...

We offer theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of the algorithm, as well as empirical and practical evidence for its high quality and performance.

In each of these scenarios, ...

Because of their ability to preserve structures, we call this class of techniques structural image editing.

In other words, given images or regions A and B, find for every patch in A the nearest neighbor in B under a patch distance metric such as L p . We call this mapping the Nearest-Neighbor Field \(NNF\), illustrated schematically in the inset figure. Approaching this problem with a naive brute force search is expensive O\(mM^2\) for image regions and patches of size M and m pixels, respectively.

As a reminder, the key insights that motivate this algorithm are that...

Today, artificial intelligence \(AI\) is a thriving field with many practical applications and active research topics.

One of the key challenges in artificial intelligence is how to get this informal knowledge into a computer.

Surpass the ... barrier.

We show both theoretically and empirically that the algorithm has good convergence properties for tested imagery up to 2MP, and our CPU implementation shows speedups of 20-100 times versus kd-trees with PCA.

Script identification facilitates many important applications.

A Markov random field, also known as a Markov network or an undirected graphical model \(Kindermann and Snell, 1980\), has a set of nodes each of which corresponds to a variable or group of variables, as well as a set of links each of which connects a pair of nodes.

However, these activities can be viewed as two facets of the same field, and together they have undergone substantial development over the past ten years.

Let us consider a CNN layer and its corresponding activation tensor A ∈ R \(C × H × W\) , which consists of C feature planes with spatial dimensions H × W.
